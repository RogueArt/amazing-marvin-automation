# Amazing Marvin Automation

Amazing Marvin Automation is designed to streamline and automate specific workflows within the [Amazing Marvin](https://amazingmarvin.com/) productivity app. This project includes a wide range of features from creating tasks based on recorded habits to auto-scheduling tasks based on weather conditions. This tool is ideal for users looking to enhance their productivity and task management efficiency within Amazing Marvin.

## Get Started & Initial Setup

### Prerequisites
Verify that these programs are on your computer before proceeding. Otherwise, use these links to download them:
* [NodeJS v20 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Git (Version Control)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* A server to host and run this program, ex. [DigitalOcean droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Heroku Dyno](https://www.heroku.com/), [AWS EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/),

**Note:** This application is currently meant to be self-hosted on a server. However, I do have plans to migrating this to be a browser extension as well as figuring out ways to have users be able to use this without having to self-host this.
